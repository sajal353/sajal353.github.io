            <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__delay-2s">The Global Equity Movement Foundation is an organization taking a comprehensive approach to improving the social welfare of Black people around the world. The organization is made up of three complimentary <a href="updates.html">programs</a> that we use to identify and execute on high value opportunities for economic development on a community by community basis.</p>
            <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__delay-3s">We are an independent organization â€“ free from the influences of any other entity. This means we serve you only. However, this also means we rely more heavily on your <a href="donate.html">support</a>. We understand we need to earn your trust, and that that trust you show is not unconditional. To that end, we aim to always be one of the most transparent organizations you will come across.<sup>1</sup> </p>
            <p class="animate__animated" id="si1">We also understand that your trust gives us power. And collectively, when we have the trust of an entire people, as we hope to have earned one day, the problems facing Black communities across the world will resolve. The Movement begins and ends with <a href="donate.html">you</a>. We know that. We need you to know that, and to remember that. </p>
