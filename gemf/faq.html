            <h3 id="p1">How can I join as a paid employee to help organize the programs?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Although GEM is not currently hiring paid employees to manage and organize its programs, if you want to express your interest, please send us an <a href="mailto:potentialemployees@globalequitymovement.org">email</a>. Also, keep an eye out for updates and job postings when we do begin hiring for these positions. </p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="p2">Does GEM sell the data it collects?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>No! Absolutely not. We are incredibly grateful for every piece of information and data we receive. It helps us better understand the state of Black people around the world and how we can mobilize resources to address the issues in the order they need to be addressed. The data is yours and is used for GEM, and GEM alone. Our bylaws and <a href="privacy.html">privacy policy</a> not only do not allow us to sell your data, but they require us to take every reasonable precaution and measure to protect your data. No! Absolutely not. We are incredibly grateful for every piece of information and data we receive. It helps us better understand the state of Black people around the world and how we can mobilize resources to address the issues in the order they need to be addressed. The data is yours and is used for GEM, and GEM alone. Our bylaws and privacy policy [link: privacy policy page] not only do not allow us to sell your data, but they require us to take every reasonable precaution and measure to protect your data. </p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="p3">I want to participate in one of the Special Situations Teams. How do I do that?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Although GEM is not currently hiring for SST teams, if you want to express your interest, please send us an <a href="mailto:potentialemployees@globalequitymovement.org">email</a>. Also, keep an eye out for updates and job postings when we do begin hiring for these positions.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="p4">How do I request a program for my area?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>There is no way to request a program in your area. We allocate resources according to need and impact. We believe strongly that the order in which our group’s issues are addressed affects the durability of the solutions, and we rely on our data to inform us of the proper order.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="p5">How do I know if a program is operating in my area?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Check our <a href="updates.html">Programs and Updates</a> page.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="j1">Do I have the skills that GEM is looking for?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Occasionally we will post any skills deficits we have for priority projects. Otherwise, we have a real need for all hard skills, and we encourage you to <a href="join.html">sign up</a> and let us know what you have to offer. Thank you in advance.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="j2">Will I be paid as a volunteer?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Most likely, no.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="j3">Will my expenses be paid to relocate for on-site projects?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Most likely, no. However, we will work with you to minimize those expenses. Housing can be arranged, and in some cases, transportation.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="j4">What if I cannot commit to the whole project term?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>If you cannot commit to the project’s full expected term, we may still include you if we can find a complementary volunteer to take over your role once you leave.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="j5">How long will GEM keep my information and availability?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Typically, we would expect your information and availability to perform as a volunteer to remain current for five years. We therefore would keep your information listed as current for that period of time. After that, it would be removed.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="j6">How do I update my data and availability?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>When you sign up to join us as a project volunteer you will receive a confirming email of the information you shared. There will also be a link in that email that will take you to a page with a form where you can update your information and availability.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="j7">Can I join as a volunteer to help with general operations?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Yes! Yes, you can. If you are interested in helping with general operations, please send us an <a href="mailto:operationsvolunteers@globalequitymovement.org">email</a> </p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="d1">Is my donation tax deductible?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Our application with the IRS for recognition of tax exemption (501(c)3) is pending. Although donations made now will qualify for an income tax duction if our application is approved, there is a possibility that our application will not be approved.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="d2">Can I choose which program(s) my donation will benefit?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Not at the moment. However, we may add that functionality to the donation portal at some point in the future.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="d3">How do I cancel my recurring donation?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>In your donation confirmation email, there is a link that will allow you to cancel a recurring donation. If you no longer have your confirmation email, you can <a href="mailto:donations@globalequitymovement.org">email</a> us.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="d4">How much of my donation will service the programs?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Efficiency is a priority for us. In our quarterly and annual reports you will be able see what percentage of our income from donations goes to servicing our programs. We strive to maintain a minimum of 87% of donated funds going to our programs.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="d5">Can I donate in a currency other than US Dollars? </h3>
            <br>
            <p>Yes, through our donation portal, donations made in any currency other than US Dollars will be converted to US Dollars. Your financial institution may charge a fee.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="d6">Can I donate company shares?</h3>
