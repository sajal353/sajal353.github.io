You should treat your Card with the same care as you would treat cash.  We encourage you to sign your Card when you receive it. This Card is intended for personal, family, or household use and not intended for business purposes. Your Card account does not constitute a checking or savings account and is not connected in any way to any other account you may have.  The Card is not a gift card, nor is it intended to be used for gifting purposes.  The Card is not a credit card.  You will not receive any interest on the funds in your Card account.  We may close your Card or refuse to process any transaction that we believe may violate the terms of this Agreement or represents illegal or fraudulent activity.  You are responsible for notifying us immediately upon any change to your address, phone number, or email address.  If your address changes to a non-US address, we may cancel your Card and return funds to you in accordance with this Agreement.</p></li><li style="padding: 0px; margin: 1em 0px 0px;"><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><b>VERIFYING YOUR CARD</b></p><p style="padding: 0px; margin: 1em 0px 0px;"><b>Important information for opening a Card account</b>:  To help the federal government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, the USA PATRIOT Act requires all financial institutions and their third parties to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens a Card.<br><b>What this means for you</b>:  When you request a Card, we will ask for your name, street address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you.  We may also ask to see a copy of your driver's license or other documents at any time.  You may be limited in use and features until we have been able to successfully verify your identity.<br><b>Eligibility and Activation</b>:  To be eligible to use and activate the Card, you represent and warrant to us that: (i) you are at least 18 years of age; (ii) the personal information that you have provided to us is true, correct and complete; (iii) you have read this Agreement and agree to be bound by and comply with its terms.</p></li><li style="padding: 0px; margin: 1em 0px 0px;"><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><b>UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS</b></p><ol style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 1.2em;"><li style="padding: 0px; margin: 1em 0px 0px;"><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><b>Contact in Event of Unauthorized Transfer</b></p><p style="padding: 0px; margin: 1em 0px 0px;">If you believe your Card has been lost or stolen, call or write Customer Service IMMEDIATELY at the contact information found at the beginning of this Agreement.</p></li><li style="padding: 0px; margin: 1em 0px 0px;"><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><b>Your Liability for Unauthorized Transactions</b></p><p style="padding: 0px; margin: 1em 0px 0px;">Tell us AT ONCE if you believe your Card has been lost or stolen, or if you believe that an electronic fund transfer has been made without your permission. Calling Customer Service is the best way of keeping your possible losses down. You could lose all the money in your account. If you tell us within 2 business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Card, you can lose no more than $50 if someone used your Card without your permission. If you do NOT tell us within 2 business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Card, and we can prove we could have stopped someone from using your Card without your permission if you had told us, you could lose as much as $500.<br>Also, if your electronic history shows transfers that you did not make, including those made by your Card or other means, tell us at once. If you do not tell us within 60 days after the earlier of the date you electronically accessed your account (if the unauthorized transfer could be viewed in your electronic history), or the date we sent the FIRST written history on which the unauthorized transfer appeared, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time. If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we will extend the time periods.<br><b>Your Card may have some additional protections against unauthorized use</b>:<br>Visa Zero Liability policy covers U.S.-issued Visa-branded Cards only and does not apply to ATM transactions, PIN transactions not process by Visa, certain commercial card transactions, or unregistered cards. You must notify us promptly of any unauthorized use.

Customer Service hours may differ.</p></li></ol></li><li style="padding: 0px; margin: 1em 0px 0px;"><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><b>USING YOUR CARD</b></p><ol style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 1.2em;"><li style="padding: 0px; margin: 1em 0px 0px;"><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><b>Accessing and Loading Funds</b></p><p style="padding: 0px; margin: 1em 0px 0px;"><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Each time you use your Card, you authorize us to reduce the value available on your Card by the amount of the transaction and applicable fees.  If you use your Card number without presenting your Card (such as for an internet transaction, a mail order or a telephone purchase), the legal effect will be the same as if you used the Card itself. You may use your Card to purchase or lease goods or services wherever your Card is honored as long as you do not exceed the value available in your Card account.</p><div style="padding: 0px; margin: 1em 0px 0px; justify-items: stretch;"><h3 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Your Card can also be used to:</h3><ol style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 1.2em;"><li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">load funds to your Card account;</li><li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">transfer funds between your Card accounts whenever you request; and</li><li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">pay bills directly [by telephone] from your Card account.</li></ol></div><p style="padding: 0px; margin: 1em 0px 0px;"><b>You CANNOT use your Card to:</b> (i) exchange your Card for its cash value; (ii) perform any illegal transactions; (iii) use the bank routing number and account number to make a debit transaction with any item processed as a check (these debits will be declined and your payment will not be processed); or (iv) make business-related transactions. In addition, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO EXCEED THE AVAILABLE AMOUNT IN YOUR CARD ACCOUNT THROUGH AN INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTION OR A SERIES OF TRANSACTIONS. Nevertheless, if a transaction exceeds the balance of the funds available in your Card account, you will remain fully liable to us for the amount of the transaction and agree to pay us promptly for the negative balance. If your Card has a negative balance, any deposits will be used to offset the negative balance. We may also use any deposit or balance on another Card you have with us to offset a negative balance on this Card.</p><p style="padding: 0px; margin: 1em 0px 0px;"><b>Loading the Card account:</b> You may add funds to your Card, called "loading," by: (i) Automated Clearing House ("ACH") loads (e.g., direct deposit); (ii) Loading cash through one of our reload locations (a list is available at liquidklear.com);or call customer service at 833-263-6691. See the Limits table below for limitations on amount and frequency for different load methods. Each load may be subject to a fee as set out in the Long Form. If you arrange to have funds transferred directly to your Card from a third party through an ACH load, you must enroll with the third party by providing the bank routing number and direct deposit account number that we provide you. <b>The only federal payments that may be loaded to your Card via ACH credit are federal payments for the benefit of the primary cardholder. If you have questions about this requirement, please call Customer Service.</b> We will reject any loads that exceed the maximum balance allowed on your Card. There are also maximum load restrictions we may place on your Card when aggregated with any other Cards you have. You agree to present your Card and meet identification requirements to complete load transactions as may be required from time to time.</p><p style="padding: 0px; margin: 1em 0px 0px;"><b>Split Transactions:</b> If you do not have enough funds available in your Card account, you may be able to instruct the merchant to charge a part of the purchase to the Card and pay the remaining amount with another form of payment. These are called "split transactions". Some merchants do not allow cardholders to split transactions or will only allow you to do a split transaction if you pay the remaining amount in cash.</p></p></li><li style="padding: 0px; margin: 1em 0px 0px;"><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><b>Limits</b></p><div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: auto auto; gap: 1px; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); justify-items: stretch; padding: 1px; margin: 0.5em 0px 0px;"><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.4em; text-align: center; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); grid-column-end: span 2;"><b>Load, Withdrawal and Spend Limits<sup>*</sup></b></p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.4em; background-color: rgb(136, 136, 136); color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><b>Load Limitations</b></p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.4em; background-color: rgb(136, 136, 136); color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><b>Limit</b></p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.4em; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Maximum Card balance at any time</p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.4em; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">$10,000.00</p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.4em; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Maximum Bank to Card Load via LiquidKlear Mobile App (ACH)</p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.4em; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Up to 5 reloads per rolling twenty-four (24) hours $10.00 minimum, $1,000.00 per transaction, and $3,000.00 daily limit</p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.4em; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Direct Deposit</p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.4em; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">No limit to the number of times per day; maximum $5,000.00 per transaction</p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.4em; background-color: rgb(136, 136, 136); color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><b>Withdrawal Limitations</b></p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.4em; background-color: rgb(136, 136, 136); color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><b>Limit</b></p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.4em; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">ATM Cash Withdrawal</p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.4em; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">No more than 3 per rolling twenty-four (24) hours, up to $500.00 per transaction, and up to $500.00 per rolling twenty-four (24) hours</p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.4em; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Over the Counter Cash Withdrawal</p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.4em; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">No more than 3 per rolling twenty-four (24) hours, up to $500.00 per transaction, and up to $500.00 per rolling twenty-four (24) hours</p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.4em; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Maximum amount of ATM or over the counter cash withdrawal</p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.4em; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">No more that $500.00 per rolling twenty-four (24) hours</p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.4em; background-color: rgb(136, 136, 136); color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><b>Spend Limitations</b></p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.4em; background-color: rgb(136, 136, 136); color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><b>Limit</b></p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.4em; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Maximum spend for purchases, over the counter and ATM withdrawals</p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.4em; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">No more than $5,000 per rolling twenty-four (24) hours</p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.4em; text-align: center; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); grid-column-end: span 2;"><sup>*</sup> Third parties may impose additional limitations.</p></div></li><li style="padding: 0px; margin: 1em 0px 0px;"><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><b>Foreign Transactions</b></p><p style="padding: 0px; margin: 1em 0px 0px;">If you obtain your funds (or make a purchase) in a currency or country other than the currency or country in which your Card was issued (<b>"Foreign Transaction"</b>), the amount deducted from your funds will be converted by the network or card association that processes the transaction into an amount in the currency of your Card. The rate they choose is either: (i) selected from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets (which may vary from the rate the association itself receives), or (ii) the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date.  The conversion rate selected by the network is independent of any fee that we charge as compensation for our services.

Once the final payment amount is received, the preauthorization amount on hold will be removed. During this time, you will not have access to preauthorized amounts. If you authorize a transaction and then fail to make a purchase of that item as planned, the approval may result in a hold for that amount of funds.</p></li></ol></li><li style="padding: 0px; margin: 1em 0px 0px;"><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><b>ERROR RESOLUTION PROCEDURES</b></p><p style="padding: 0px; margin: 1em 0px 0px;"><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><b>In Case of Errors or Questions about Your Prepaid Account:</b> Call or write Customer service at the Phone Number, Address, or Website mentioned above as soon as you can, if you think an error has occurred in your prepaid account.
